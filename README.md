# Just-Jubilate

This repository is a cleaned-up version of the one submitted to the 2024 cuHacking Computer Vision Event.

Just Jubilate addresses these issues by tracking **full-body** poses and comparing them to a dance video, necessitating actual exercise and engagement in order to be awarded points for adherence. 

Even just 2 minutes of daily exercise can improve heart health, boost mood, and reduce stress, with studies showing that regular physical activity can reduce health risks by up to 14%. So throw on a quick song and... *Just Jubilate*!
